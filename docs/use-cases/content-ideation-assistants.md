# Content Ideation Assistants Blueprint

Pair editorial teams with an on-brand phrasing engine that bootstraps outlines, subject lines, and synopsis copy.

## Ideal Scenarios
- You maintain a library of launch notes, changelog entries, or marketing emails with discernible tone.
- Your writers need rapid first drafts that remain faithful to brand voice.
- You want content suggestions inside familiar tooling (Nova, Filament, custom CMS).

## Corpus Strategy
- Aggregate approved copy into `corpus.txt` files or Eloquent models with `body`, `tags`, and `status` fields.
- Clean up noisy artifacts; remove merge tags and variable placeholders before training.
- Tokenize using `Tokenizer` for consistent word boundaries and custom vocab (e.g., product-specific jargon).

```php
$documents = ReleaseNote::published()
    ->orderBy('published_at')
    ->pluck('body');

Markovable::text()
    ->tokenizer(fn ($text) => Tokenizer::make()
        ->preserve(['AI', 'SaaS', 'CLI'])
        ->tokenize($text))
    ->train($documents)
    ->cache('editorial-voice:v1');
```

## Prompt Engineering
- Combine seeds with control hints like tone or structure keywords.
- Limit token output for concise copy and iterate when writers request new variations.

```php
$outline = Markovable::cache('editorial-voice:v1')
    ->generate(80, [
        'seed' => 'Launch email outline | tone:uplifting | include:beta CTA',
        'temperature' => 0.7,
        'fallback' => 'Release day narrative outline',
    ]);
```

## Editorial Workflow Integration
- Expose generation via Artisan commands for Slack bots or scheduled drafts.

```bash
php artisan markovable:generate text \
  --cache="editorial-voice:v1" \
  --length=60 \
  --seed="Product update teaser | tone:pragmatic"
```

- Add Nova action or Filament widget to deliver suggestions directly inside CMS forms:

```php
class DraftOutline extends Action
{
    public function handle(ActionFields $fields, Collection $models)
    {
        $seed = sprintf('%s | persona:%s', $fields->input('topic'), $fields->input('persona'));

        $draft = Markovable::cache('editorial-voice:v1')
            ->generate($fields->input('length', 90), ['seed' => $seed]);

        return Action::message($draft);
    }
}
```

## Continuous Learning Loop
- Capture editor revisions and push the finalized copy back into the training dataset.

```php
Event::listen(ContentApproved::class, function (ContentApproved $event) {
    Markovable::text()
        ->cache('editorial-voice:v1')
        ->append($event->content)
        ->retrain();
});
```

- Version caches (`editorial-voice:v1.2`) to roll back quickly if tone drifts.

## Instrumentation and Quality Gates
- Use `MarkovableAssertions` in tests to guard against regression in vocabulary coverage.

```php
$this->markovableCache('editorial-voice:v1')
    ->assertGeneratesSequenceContaining('launch announcement', 'customer stories');
```

- Emit `ContentGenerated` events to feed analytics dashboard with usage stats.

## Inspiration Paths
- Auto-fill changelog entries by seeding with Jira issue summaries.
- Draft onboarding email sequences per segment (starter, power user, enterprise) using segmented caches.
- Spin up PR description templates from commit metadata to keep engineering rituals consistent.
- Prototype marketing experiments faster by generating headline variants for A/B testing.

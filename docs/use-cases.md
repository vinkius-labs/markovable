# Use Cases

Markovable thrives wherever adaptive journeys matter. Here are a few battle-tested scenarios to spark ideas.

## Product Guidance Flows

Generate navigation hints based on historical behavior so new users discover value faster. Feed Markovable with page transitions and let it suggest the most likely next step.

## Content Ideation Assistants

Empower editorial teams with on-demand phrasing. Train chains on past releases, then seed them with fresh prompts to draft outlines that still sound on-brand.

## Support Response Acceleration

Model prior ticket resolutions and surface predicted replies when a new request arrives. Agents stay consistent while shaving precious minutes from response times.

## Feature Adoption Campaigns

Analyze Markovable predictions to pinpoint drop-off moments in onboarding. Craft targeted nudges and measure the uplift as the chain re-trains on the latest journeys.

## Embedded Analytics

Ship Markovable inside your SaaS and expose predictions directly to customersâ€”whether they want smarter menus, next-best-action hints, or bite-sized trend summaries.

Markovable is intentionally composable. Start with a single experiment, then let curiosity and iteration guide the roadmap.

# Markovable

Markovable is a Laravel-native engine for building adaptive Markov chains that learn from your productâ€™s voice and user journeys. It turns familiar Eloquent patterns into powerful prediction, generation, anomaly detection, and analysis flows so you can ship intelligent experiences without leaving PHP.

> "Give your data a memory and it will return with stories you never thought to ask." â€“ The Markovable Manifesto âœ¨

## Why Markovable?

- **Human DX** â€“ API-first design, fluent builders, and sensible defaults keep developers in flow.
- **Production Ready** â€“ Cache, database, and file storage drivers out of the box, plus queue-friendly jobs.
- **SaaS Native** â€“ Multi-tenant caching, predictive scoring, and lifecycle workflows keep subscription products informed in real time.
- **Composable** â€“ Extend analyzers, generators, and builders to fit any domain-specific language or dataset.
- **Observable** â€“ Built-in events, anomaly alerts, and exports make analytics, monitoring, and audits effortless.

## Quick Peek

```php
use VinkiusLabs\Markovable\Facades\Markovable;

$baseline = 'analytics::predictive-saas';

Markovable::chain('analytics')
    ->cache($baseline)
    ->train($historicalSessions);

$insights = Markovable::predictive($baseline)
    ->dataset($latestTenantSnapshots)
    ->usingOptions([
        'churn' => ['include_recommendations' => true],
        'ltv' => ['segments' => ['self_serve', 'enterprise'], 'include_historical' => true],
    ]);

$churnAlerts = $insights->churnScore()->get();
$ltvReport = $insights->ltv()->get();
```

## Whatâ€™s Inside

- Feature-rich `MarkovableChain` for training, caching, generating, and analyzing sequences.
- Generators tuned for natural language and navigation flows.
- Analyzer strategies to surface probabilities, detect anomalies, and predict next-best actions.
- Detectors and monitoring pipelines to surface unseen sequences, emerging patterns, seasonality shifts, and behaviour drift.
- Traits and observers that keep Eloquent models self-training.
- Artisan commands to orchestrate training, generation, and analysis from the CLI.

# Markovable

Markovable is a Laravel-native engine for building adaptive Markov chains that learn from your productâ€™s voice and user journeys. It turns familiar Eloquent patterns into powerful prediction, generation, and analysis flows so you can ship intelligent experiences without leaving PHP.

> "Give your data a memory and it will return with stories you never thought to ask." â€“ The Markovable Manifesto âœ¨

## Why Markovable?

- **Human DX** â€“ API-first design, fluent builders, and sensible defaults keep developers in flow.
- **Production Ready** â€“ Cache, database, and file storage drivers out of the box, plus queue-friendly jobs.
- **Composable** â€“ Extend analyzers, generators, and builders to fit any domain-specific language or dataset.
- **Observable** â€“ Built-in events and exports make analytics, monitoring, and audits effortless.

## Quick Peek

```php
use VinkiusLabs\Markovable\Facades\Markovable;

Markovable::train([
    'Every release deserves a narrative arc.',
    'Markovable keeps product storytelling adaptive.',
])->cache('product-narrative');

$teaser = Markovable::cache('product-narrative')
    ->generate(18, ['seed' => 'Every release']);

$nextSteps = Markovable::analyze('navigation')
    ->cache('product-narrative')
    ->predict('launch timeline', 3);
```

## Whatâ€™s Inside

- Feature-rich `MarkovableChain` for training, caching, generating, and analyzing sequences.
- Generators tuned for natural language and navigation flows.
- Analyzer strategies to surface probabilities and predict next-best actions.
- Traits and observers that keep Eloquent models self-training.
- Artisan commands to orchestrate training, generation, and analysis from the CLI.
